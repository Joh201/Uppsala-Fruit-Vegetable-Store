# Uppsala Sotre

<p>
Uppsala Store is an online fruit and vegetable store. This online store is owned by farmers in Uppsala and its surroundings. Uppsala Store enables the farmers to sell fresh and organic food to their customers in Sweden and neighbouring countries (Norway, Denmark and Finland). Through Uppsala Store farmers can easily reach, and meet the demands of their customers. The store also creates an opportunity for customers to get fresh and organic produce at their doorstep without any hassel. Thus, the website was developed to act as a bridge between producers and consumers. It runs on Code Institute's mock terminal on Heroku.
